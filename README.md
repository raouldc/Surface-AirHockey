A video of the game in action can be viewed [here](http://tiny.cc/SurfaceAirHockeyVideo)

Surface AirHockey is a competitive game for the Microsoft PixelSense table. The game has support for two player multiplayer, who can compete against each other in the game. The game consists of two goals, placed on two opposite sides of
the table. A puck rests in the centre of the table. The objective of the game is to hit the puck into the opposing goal which is
guarded by the opposing player. A point is awarded to the player who scores the goal. The game ends when three goals are scored by a player.

Interaction with the game is facilitated through the use of tangibles in the form of mallets. They are used by the player to
hit the puck into the opposing players goal. These tangibles are held in the hands of the players and are used to interact
with the touchscreen on the Microsoft PixelSense table. The use of a tangible helps to bridge the gap between the physical world of the user and the digital environment, and the world on the screen. This is done with the aim to increase the
immersiveness of the game as felt by the player. The tangibles used in Surface AirHockey also provide haptic feedback when a collision occurs between the tangible and the puck. This was done to simulate the feel of hitting a puck with a mallet in a real life Airhockey game, and so improving the immersive quality of the game.
